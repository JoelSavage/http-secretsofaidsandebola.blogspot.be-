WHY ISONIAZID AND SULFADIAZIDE ARE DANGEROUS FOR TUBERCULOSIS TREATMENT IN AFRICA?


"According to the German scientist Wolff Geisler, thousands of Aids patients affected with tuberculosis in Africa, are not caused by the HIV virus."

"In my opinion, he is right, because of the increase in the number of tuberculosis patients in Africa, is a result of intended spread of the disease through dangerous medicines like Isoniazid and Sulfadianozide , given to Africans in tuberculosis clinics in African countries, such as Burundi, the former Belgian Congo, Uganda and Zambia."- Said Holland scientist and micro-surgeon Johan Van Dongen.

Instead of curing, the two mentioned medicines rather cause a tremendous acceleration of HIV infections amongst African people.

The WHO/IUATLD Working Group And Wolff Geisler

In 1989, the WHO/IUATLD working group declared in the “Bulletin International Union Tuberculosis Lung Disease” that HIV in TB-hospitals could have been spread as a result of unhygienic anti-tuberculosis injections, but as a former micro-surgeon, I, Johan van Dongen challenge them to prove that statement.

Again according to Wolff Geisler, remarkably horrendous numbers of HIV-infections originate only from US American or British financed and managed hospitals in the respectively mentioned countries. For instance in hospitals in Kitgum and Kagando in Uganda (where there was no recognizable USA or British finance), 10% of the TB patients, normally an average of 15% of the total population were HIV infected.

Aids Causing Factories

According to the World Health Organization, in Africa 17-55% of TB patients have HIV-antibodies. The WHO expert Slutkin mentioned 30-60% in some of the developing countries, a clear sign of intentional infection of tuberculosis patients in Zambia with HIV. The same evidence was provided by the same expert in the Chinkala Hospital, TB patients Mazubuku. 23% of the TB patients in the middle of 1987 were also infected with HIV.

Six months later, the virus was located in 50% of patients within the same hospital, after administering Isoniazid and Sulfadiazide. The same figures slightly increased in 58% of TB patients in Ndola, and in 60% of TB patients in the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka, Zambia.

In the Makalala Sanatorium in Kinshasa, Zaire, 33% of TB patients had HIV antibodies (among the staff: 4-8%), and in Chinkankata 36%. In Malawi, 50-66% of TB patients also had HIV antibodies. In the TB clinic, Centre Anti Tuberculeux de Bujumbura in Burundi, 55% of TB patients were HIV-infected in 1986, and in the Mwanza region of Tanzania 25% of TB patients had HIV-antibodies. 

Moreover, the patients were treated with forbidden drugs, because in New York, 1972, about 21 people who were taking intravenous agents had succumbed to inexplicable tuberculosis before 1972.

Already written in a previous article, in contrast, patient with a cellular deficiency hypersensitivity following the polio and cowpox vaccinations, are particularly prone to certain bacterial, viral and protozoal infections caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis TB. 

And then the pharmaceutical disease producing factories appear by using deadly toxic agents such as Isoniazid, produced by Teva Netherlands BV (Holland, and Sulfadiazide, produced by Pfizer in Germany.

What Is Tuberculosis?

Tuberculosis is a chronically infectious disease which generally affects the lungs. The causing agent, tubercle bacilli, is mostly passed on from person to person through coughing of droplets from the respiratory tract (lungs), and can also be transmitted unto the skin, eyes of persons in the immediate vicinity. Tubercles also can penetrate the body through drinking.

A striking phenomenon! Side Effects Of Isoniazid And Sulfadiozanide.

Hospitals, including Mbare Hospital in Harare, were suddenly full of tuberculosis patients and the people were suffering from venereal diseases at the same time, as a side effect consequence, because Isoniazid and Sulfadiazide made them susceptible for these. It is obvious that Isoniazid and Sulfadiazide are the cause of these venereal diseases because it appears in almost all infected children under the age of ten.

As described before, in Africa tuberculosis and HIV go hand in hand, but the mass spread of tuberculosis infections in Africans with Aids is not caused by HIV-infection at all. The increase in the number of African TB patients is the result of intended spread of special tuberculosis agents, and patients treated with Sulfadiozanide and Isoniazid at the end caught Aids!

Disease Factories Using Isoniazid And Sulfadiozanide

The two medicines, Isoniazid and Sulfadiazide, shouldn’t have been used as medications against TB and most certainly not in Aids patients. Only the long list of side effects gives you the shivers. Therefore we will describe a list with side effects causing a huge amount of invented new diseases in order to sell more medicines against these side effects.

“Anxiety, blurred vision, changes in menstrual periods, chills, cold sweats, coma, confusion, cool, pale skin, decreased sexual ability in males, depression, dizziness, ‘dry’ puffy skin, fast heartbeat, feeling cold, headache, increased hunger, nausea, nervousness, nightmares, seizures, shakiness, slurred speech, swelling of front part of the neck, unusual tiredness or weakness and last but not least: weight gain.”

There You Have It. And If You Think This List Of Side Effects Is Completed, Not at all! There Is More: Let’s continue:
